# Banker's Algorithm

This program implements the Banker's Algorithm, which is used to avoid deadlocks in computer systems. It allows processes to request and release resources in a safe and efficient manner.

## Getting Started

To run the program, first install PySimpleGUI using pip: pip install PySimpleGUI

Then, clone this repository and run the following command: python banker_algorithm.py


## Usage

The program will ask for the following inputs:

- Number of processes
- Number of resources
- Total available resources
- Allocation matrix
- Max need matrix

After providing these inputs, the program will use the Banker's Algorithm to check if the system is in a safe state. It will then allow the user to request resources from a specific process.
